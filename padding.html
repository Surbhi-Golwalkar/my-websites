	<p class="a">Gwalior is a city in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It's known for its palaces and temples, including the Sas Bahu Ka Mandir intricately carved Hindu temple. Ancient Gwalior Fort occupies a sandstone plateau overlooking the city and is accessed via a winding road lined with sacred Jain statues. Within the fortâ€™s high walls is the 15th-century Gujari Mahal Palace, now an archaeological museum.

	Gwalior is best known for its imposing hilltop fort, which was famously described as 'The pearl amongst fortresses in India'. Historically, the city has been the cradle of a number of dynasties that ruled it over the years. Their influence is clearly seen in the many regal structures that dominate the cityscape. In a sense, Gwalior continues to retain a medieval majesty.
